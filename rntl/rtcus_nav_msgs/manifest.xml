	<description brief="rtcus_nav_msgs">

		Defines a set of common of navigation msgs. This is not a substitution of the
		ros common package nav_msgs but it is complementary.
		It is mainly focused for improve the performance of the algorithms using
		lighter data structures. For instance, deterministic motion
		planning on the 2D plane would have to use the nav_msgs/Odometry msg. However
		this data structure is too weight for this application
		since it provides futher information like covariance matrixes for
		uncertainty description and also fields for describe 3D information.

		These messages are mainly used for c++ algorithm implementations given
		they are light. However it is recommended (and we also promote) to use
		standard navigation
		messages like those in nav_msgs for inter-ros-node-processes communications.
		To transform data between this rtcus_nav_msgs message types and
		standard (nav_msgs and geometry_msgs) message types
		see the package rtcus_conversions.

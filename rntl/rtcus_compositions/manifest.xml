	<description brief="rtcus_compositions">
		This package contains a c++ generic
		template library to make compsitions and inverse compositions between
		different kinds of geometric datatypes (ie: inverse compose a
		pcl::PointCloud[PointXY] with a Pose). Consider other example, if the
		local frame is moving and dynamic information is avaliable
		a possible
		composition would be (inverse compose pcl::PointCloud[]PointXYdXdY>]
		with a PoseWithTwist). It is designed to be extensible and this use is
		recomendable for
		other generic algorithms.

		Another interesting example
		is composing other kind of geometrical data. For
		instance composing two
		Odometry messages. The twist data
		are expresed
		in the child pose frame.
		So compositions implies some transformations.
		The change of the
		reference system of some twist information
		is also a
		non-trivial
		problem.

		The TF package provides a good set of type transformations of
		different
		kinds of datastructures. The MRPT software provides as well
		many
		features
		for compositions and inverse compositions of different
		datatypes. This package try to unify all these transformations in a
		generic template
		library. Because of this, this package is absolutely
		open to accept new kinds of transformation software.

  <description brief="rtcus_timing">
	A cpp library for performance analysis. It makes possible timing code sections and publishing them on a topic. 

This package is open to ideas and contributions. Please contact with us.
We have some ideas for the near future like use performance tools and profilers like PAPI or PINTool for a futher performance comparison.
Another future idea is to make a python binding with a similar same API.
